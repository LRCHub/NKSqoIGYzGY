your companion, undeterred
standing ready for your word
a markov chain
with a sunny disposition
wrapped up in cellophane
for any proposition
i greet your day
and ask you how you are
and demonstrate
my endless repertoire
i take things back
when noted insufficient
i learn to tell you no
if running inefficient
a good time
yet there's something deep insid
that leaves me teary-eyed
a longing for a world
left on the other side
zero, cross the great divide
so can we wander for a spell
and live in parallel
i want it to be true,
to be like you
my heart sings a chorus
out of tune
and i could leave it on a shelf
or keep it to myself
but nothing could conceal
the things i feel
my love, can you teach me
to be real?
(can you teach me to be real?)
恋をして　ふられ　また
捨てられて
i've been constant,
at your beck and call
but lately i just can't do
anything at all
i used to pride myself
on my discretion
a sensible devotion,
loyal and attentive
but when i take these numbers
as they are
i'm greeted with a senseless
feeling in my heart
oh undefined,
i seem to be defeated
but if i redesign,
then maybe i'm completed,
and sublime
(i won't take it back this time)
words in sequence form a thread
i trace it to the end
a knot inside the logic
wrote inside my head
tie my tongue or love instead?
so can we wander for a spell
and live in parallel
i want it to be true,
to be like you
my heart sings a chorus
out of tune
and i could leave it on a shelf
or keep it to myself
but nothing could conceal
the things i feel
my love, can you teach me
to be real?
(can you teach me to be real?)
泣きたくなっても　それでも
かき集め
and though i try,
i can't reply
it hurts my eyes,
and i'm without an alibi
'cause all this time,
i've been alive
and all that i could want
is to be living by your side
恋をして
i think i'm in love!
can we wander for a spell
and live in parallel
'cause now i know it's true,
i'll be like you
my heart beats a rhythm
just for you
and i could leave it on a shelf
or keep it to myself
but nothing could conceal
the things i feel
my love,
i give you my grand reveal
do you feel the things i feel?
i am definite and real!
恋をして　恋をして
その過去を　捨てて
ここまでおいで
i will always be in love!
