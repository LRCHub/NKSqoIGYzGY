High above is a plastic dove
Watch it fly above the pure synthetic ocean
Daydream tides moving in slow motion
I'm away on a holiday
I downloaded an exotic location
Met her on my virtual vacation

I'm in love (What?) with a machine
I know it is hard to believe
But, the machine is into me
I'm in love with a machine

They took a peek of my search history
They made her a composite of what I'd been browsing
Programmed to be perfectly arousing
It's hard to say what is real or fake (fake, fake, fake)
Are these her feelings or just approximations?
Triggered to get the right vibrations

I'm in love (What?) with a machine
I know it is hard to believe
But, the machine is into me
I'm in love with a machine

I'm in love with android
I fell in love with android
Yes, I'm in love with android
I fell in love with android

I'm in love (What?) with a machine
I know it is hard to believe
But, the machine is into me
I'm in love with a machine
