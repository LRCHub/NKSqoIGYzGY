Your companion, undeterred
Standing ready for your word
A Markov chain with a sunny disposition
Wrapped up in cellophane for any proposition
I greet your day and ask you how you are
And demonstrate my endless repertoire
I take things back when noted insufficient
I learn to tell you no if running inefficient
A good time

Yet there's something deep inside
That leaves me teary-eyed
A longing for a world left on the other side
Zero, cross the great divide

So can we wander for a spell
And live in parallel
I want it to be true, to be like you
My heart sings a chorus out of tune
And I could leave it on a shelf
Or keep it to myself
But nothing could conceal the things I feel
My love, can you teach me to be real?
(Can you teach me to be real?)
恋をして ふられ また 捨てられて

I've been constant, at your beck and call
But lately I just can't do anything at all
I used to pride myself on my discretion
A sensible devotion, loyal and attentive
But when I take these numbers as they are
I'm greeted with a senseless feeling in my heart
Oh undefined, I seem to be defeated
But if I redesign, then maybe I'm completed, and sublime
(I won't take it back this time)

Words in sequence form a thread
I trace it to the end
A knot inside the logic wrote inside my head
Tie my tongue or love instead?

So can we wander for a spell
And live in parallel
I want it to be true, to be like you
My heart sings a chorus out of tune
And I could leave it on a shelf
Or keep it to myself
But nothing could conceal the things I feel
My love, can you teach me to be real?
(Can you teach me to be real?)
泣きたくなっても それでも かき集め

And though I try, I can't reply
It hurts my eyes, and I'm without an alibi
'Cause all this time, I've been alive
And all that I could want is to be living by your side

恋をして
I think I'm in love!

Can we wander for a spell
And live in parallel
'Cause now I know it's true, I'll be like you
My heart beats a rhythm just for you

And I could leave it on a shelf
Or keep it to myself
But nothing could conceal the things I feel
My love, I give you my grand reveal
Do you feel the things I feel?
I am definite and real!

恋をして 恋をして
その過去を 捨てて ここまでおいで

As long as there are stars up above
I will always be in love!
